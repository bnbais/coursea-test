""" 
    Reverses the order of the characters in the given word.

    For example:
    - If we call reverse_word("abcde"), we'll get "edcba" in return
    - If we call reverse_word("a b c d e"), we'll get "e d c b a" in return
    - If we call reverse_word("a  b"), we'll get "b  a" in return
    - If we call reverse_word(""), we'll get "" in return

    Hint(s):
    - You can iterate over a word in reverse and access each character
